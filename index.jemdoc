== About me
I am currently a R.H. Bing postoctoral fellow in [https://www.ma.utexas.edu the Department of Mathematics] at [https://www.utexas.edu UT Austin].
I will join the [https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division (CEMSE)]
at [https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)]
as a Research Scientist in July 2022.


I received the B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [http://http://www.scu.edu.cn Sichuan University] in 2014.
In Summer of 2019, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computational Mathematics under the supervision of [http://www.personal.psu.edu/jxx1/ Prof. Jinchao Xu] and [http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~hujun/ Prof. Jun Hu] at [https://www.pku.edu.cn Peking University] at Beijing, China. From 2019 to 2020, I worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar supervised by [http://www.personal.psu.edu/jxx1/ Prof. Jinchao Xu] in [https://ccma.math.psu.edu The Center for Computational Mathematics and Application (CCMA)] in the [https://math.psu.edu/ Department of Mathematics] at [https://www.psu.edu/ The Pennsylvania State University, University Park].




== Research
- Deep Learning, Stochastic Optimization.
- Numerical Analysis, Finite Element Methods, Multigrid Methods.

My research interests are in algorithm development and theoretical analysis for machine learning and numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). I have received broad and in-depth training in finite element, multigrid (MG) methods and machine learning. I have studied the finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) method both for its theoretical analysis and also the application in structure-preserving discretization for multi-physical systems. I have also applied techniques from numerical PDEs for understanding and improving deep learning models and algorithms in data science. In particular, I have worked on three different but related topics:
. finite element methods and deep neural networks (DNNs);
. multigrid methods and architecture of convolutional neural networks;
. stochastic optimization methods.
