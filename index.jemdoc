== About me
I am currently an Assistant Professor at [https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Yau Mathematical Sciences Center] at Tsinghua University. Before that, I was a research scientist in [https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division (CEMSE)] at [https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)].

I received a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [http://http://www.scu.edu.cn Sichuan University] in 2014.
In the Summer of 2019, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computational Mathematics under the supervision of [https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/profiles/jinchao-xu Prof. Jinchao Xu] and [http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~hujun/ Prof. Jun Hu] at [https://www.pku.edu.cn Peking University] in Beijing, China.
From 2019 to 2020, I worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar supervised by [https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/profiles/jinchao-xu Prof. Jinchao Xu]
#in [https://ccma.math.psu.edu The Center for Computational Mathematics and Application (CCMA)]
in the [https://math.psu.edu/ Department of Mathematics] at [https://www.psu.edu/ The Pennsylvania State University, University Park].
From 2020 to 2022, I was an R.H. Bing postdoctoral fellow working with [https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ytsai/ Prof. Richard Tsai] and [https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward Prof. Rachel Ward] in [https://www.ma.utexas.edu the Department of Mathematics] at [https://www.utexas.edu UT Austin, Austin].



== Research
- Deep Learning, Stochastic Optimization.
- Numerical Analysis, Finite Element Methods, Multigrid Methods.


My research focuses on mathematical analysis, algorithm development, and their applications in machine learning and scientific computing, spanning both data and physical sciences. My Ph.D. training was grounded in classical numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular emphasis on finite element methods (FEM) and multigrid methods. Armed with this solid foundation in numerical PDEs and scientific computing, my primary research objective is to explore deep learning models and algorithms through the lens of numerical PDEs and geometry. This approach aims to foster a comprehensive understanding and innovative advancement of these models, covering theoretical foundations, algorithmic strategies, and practical applications. From my Ph.D. program to the present, and continuing into the foreseeable future, my research efforts and aspirations are principally centered on three interrelated themes:
. Mathematical analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) from a finite element perspective;
. Development of theories, algorithms, and applications for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, drawing inspiration from multigrid structures;
. Investigation into the learning of data with low-dimensional structures.
